Ideas for a v3 version of the DB that has better performance characteristics.


* coin_record


`Schema`: `Protocol` representing proposed schema for coin_record table.
  - blockchain_v2_mainnet.py: a `Schema` that can read existing blockchain_v2_mainnet.db files.

dump_blocks: tool to dump a replay file from an instance of a `Schema`
load_blocks: tool to load a replay file from an instance of a `Schema`


* NOTES:

Inserting into `coin_ids_by_hash` is slow IF inserting in `confirmed_index` order and index exists.
So create the index at the end. We can group by `confirmed_index` and store these values in a separate table.
