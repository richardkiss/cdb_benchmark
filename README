Ideas for a v3 version of the DB that has better performance characteristics.


* coin_record




* NOTES:

Inserting into `coin_ids_by_hash` is slow IF inserting in `confirmed_index` order and index exists.
So create the index at the end. We can group by `confirmed_index` and store these values in a separate table.
